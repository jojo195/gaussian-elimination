# gaussian-elimination
Homework for parallel programming course

The gaussian elimination is a very universal problem, and this public repository is only for the annoying student homework. If you are meant to find some authorized algorithms, please search for other work which is more professional. 

CLAIM: NO PLAGIARISM IS ADMITTED!!!

Three parallel algorithm for gaussian elimination is implemented, including intuitive parallel algorithm, interleaved paralllel algorithm as well as pipelined parallel algorithm. 

run * ./run.sh * to run this benchmark.
